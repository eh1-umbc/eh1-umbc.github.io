Central Maryland Tournament City Games LLC is where I currently work, with duties including repairwork and running the video game side of the store on weekends. Prior to this, I worked for the municipal government in Middletown, MD, where I summarized and created local legislation and assisted the public works department. This summer I'll be working for UMBC's GES department and Washington County's stormwater management specialist.

In terms of education, I am pursuing a B.A. in Geography and Environmental Systems with a minor in Political Science and a GIScience certificate at UMBC (expected graduation in 2025). I also have an A.A. in Sociology from Frederick Community College, obtained in 2023.

My skills include proficiency in programs like ArcGIS Pro and QGIS, as well as repair work on automobiles and electronics, including soldering. I've also worked on my 2000 Buick LeSabre too much, replacing brake lines, brake pads, rotors, upper intake manifold, spark plugs, and air filters. I am also a pianist and flautist.
